# Climate Related Natural Disasters - Public Data Repository

## Why Was This Data Created?
This data compilation was created for Professor Gotzeler's English 105 Class in the 2024 Spring Semeseter. 

## What Does This Repository Contain?
This repository contains the original dataset, the subset I created to make the visualization included further down. 

## About This Data
This data is collected from the IMF Climate Change Dashboard. It compiles data from dozens of countries over the past 40 years of the frequency of various natural disasters. These natural disasters include storms, floods, droughts, landslides, wildfires, and extreme temperatures.

The data was found on this website: https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data

## What Could This Data Be Used For?
This data has many possible uses. It could be used to:
- Look at specific natural disaster trends over the last 40 years
- Look at natural disaster trends as a whole over the last 40 years
- Examine the frequencey of natural disasters during a specific year or for a specific country
- Predict future trends in natural disaster frequencies

## Data Visualization
This bar graph examines the trend of the total natural disaster frequency in just the United States over the past 4o years, from 1980 to 2020. This visualization was created using the website Datawrapper. This graph shows that as a whole, natural disasters in the US are on the rise. This may be the result of climate change, since these natural disasters are climate-related.
